            <h2>Advances in Stem Cell Therapy</h2>
            <p>
                In recent human history, the study of cloning has been the dream of researchers the world
                over. In animal models we find that “cloning” otherwise known as parthenogenesis or asexual
                reproduction provides unique ways for organisms to adapt to environmental stressors.
                <br>
                 This
                ability to regenerate life has been a number of solitary aquatic organisms and organisms with
                complex social structures such as bees and ants. Humans are currently experiencing impacts
                from the human created systems, which is why we see increased numbers of gene, and
                mutation related illnesses, such as kidney diseases, blood disorders, cancers, and other
                environmentally related diseases, seen in impacted individuals.
                <br>
                The human answer to regeneration lies within our ability to regenerate and our ability to heal.
                This ability comes from unipotent stem cells and multipotent stem cells. These cells are often
                found in the liver, skin, fingers, teeth, and bone marrow amongst other places. These cells are
                able to regenerate themselves. However what we seek are cells that are able to regenerate the
                entire body hence the need for pluripotent stem cells.
